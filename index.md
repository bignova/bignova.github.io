## About Me

My name is Wu Yimeng (吴奕蒙), a research engineer at Sohu.

My primary areas of interest lie in technologies such as large language models, image generation, reinforcement learning, and intelligent agents.

Currently, my focus is on understanding how these advanced technologies can effectively tackle specific challenges within vertical industries like news media, and how they can be better applied in innovative media products.
